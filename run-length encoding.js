/*
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

Task
Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

	for (let i=0; i<str.length; i++) {
		if (str[i] !== str[i+1]) {
			arr.push([value, str[i]]);
			value = 1;
		} else {
			value++;
		}
	}
	return arr;
